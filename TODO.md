# TODO

In *ManagementConsole run()* - should we try to sleep up until the closest 30/sec interval to get most fresh data?
Or should we get more data-samples and keep track of which we have processed already ?  And then sleep for shorter times.

Set how many samples to ask for and process.
Loop samples.
Keep track of sample status and if they are processed.
